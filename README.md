# FirstGoApp
My First GO! application, with some changes. This project partially reflect the author trace in learning of GO programming language,
and contains these exercises:
- Fibonacci closure (https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/26);
- rot13Reader implementation (https://tour.golang.org/methods/23);
- Image interface implementation (https://tour.golang.org/methods/25).
